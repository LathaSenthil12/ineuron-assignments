        "\n",
        "Ans: ____getattribute ____ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. ____getattr __  is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by ____getattribute__, but for this ____getattribute ____ and ____getattr__ __ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, __getattr__ returns a default value. So key difference is that ____getattr ____ is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class.\n",
